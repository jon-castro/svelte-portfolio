It uses the Svelte framework (https://svelte.dev/) to fetch and show content, do routing, and hold all the logic for all of it. The Tailwind CSS framework (https://tailwindcss.com/) is used for most of the styling within. The 'svelte-simple-modal' repo (https://github.com/flekschas/svelte-simple-modal) was adapted for the site to be able to change based on the color schemes.",
